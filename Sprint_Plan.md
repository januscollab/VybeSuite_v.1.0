# Sprint Board Project Plan

This document outlines the sprint-by-sprint plan for building the comprehensive React-based Scrum Board application. Each sprint focuses on specific features and functionalities, with a clear objective and risk assessment.

---

## Sprint 1: Project Setup & Core UI Foundation ✅ IN PROGRESS

**Objective**: Set up the basic project structure, integrate the design system, and build the static layout of the main Sprint Board UI.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Tailwind CSS configured with DevSuite design system colors.
- `App.tsx` rendering the main header and static sprint grid layout.
- Static HTML structure from `sprint_card_prompt.html` translated into React components.
- Lucide React icons integrated for UI elements.
- Basic responsive layout (desktop-first).

**Tasks**:
1. ✅ **Configure Tailwind CSS for DevSuite Design System**
2. ✅ **Create Core `App.tsx` Structure**
3. ✅ **Integrate Lucide React Icons**
4. ✅ **Implement Basic Responsiveness**

**Risk Assessment**: **LOW**
- **Breaking Change Risk**: Minimal. This sprint primarily involves setting up the UI and integrating styling, with no existing application logic to break.
- **Technical Complexity**: Low. The tasks are straightforward UI development and configuration.
- **Impact**: Successful completion provides a solid visual foundation for subsequent sprints.

## Sprint 2: Story Management & Modals ✅ IN PROGRESS

**Objective**: Implement the "Add Story" modal and basic story display/interaction, including local state management for stories.

**Key Deliverables**:
- "Add New Story" modal component based on `add_story_modal.html` and `add_story_modal_spec.md`.
- Functional tag management system within the modal.
- "Generate Story" button with mock AI functionality (simulated response).
- Basic local state management for stories (add, mark complete).
- Stories displayed in sprint cards with completion checkboxes and strikethrough.

**Tasks**:
1. ✅ **Create AddStoryModal Component**
2. ✅ **Implement Tag Management System**
3. ✅ **Add Local State Management for Stories**
4. ✅ **Integrate Modal with Sprint Cards**
5. ✅ **Add Mock AI Story Generation**

**Risk Assessment**: **MEDIUM**
- **Breaking Change Risk**: Low to Medium. Adding state management may require refactoring existing components to accept dynamic data instead of mock data.
- **Technical Complexity**: Medium. Involves complex modal interactions, form validation, and state management across multiple components.
- **Impact**: This sprint establishes the core data flow and user interaction patterns that all subsequent features will build upon.

**✅ SPRINT 2 COMPLETED - END OF SPRINT REPORT**

**Actual Outcomes**:
- **✅ SUCCESS**: All deliverables completed successfully with no major issues
- **✅ ZERO BREAKING CHANGES**: Successfully refactored from mock data to dynamic state without breaking existing UI
- **✅ ENHANCED SCOPE**: Delivered beyond minimum requirements with comprehensive tag management and AI generation

**Key Achievements**:
1. **AddStoryModal Component**: Fully functional modal with DevSuite design compliance, form validation, and keyboard navigation
2. **Advanced Tag System**: Both predefined and custom tag support with visual management
3. **Robust State Management**: TypeScript-typed `useStories` hook with proper data flow
4. **Mock AI Integration**: Realistic story generation with loading states and varied content
5. **Real-time Updates**: Dynamic stats calculation and immediate UI feedback

**Technical Quality**:
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with proper interfaces
- **Component Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns and reusable patterns
- **State Management**: Centralized, predictable state updates
- **User Experience**: Smooth interactions with proper loading states and feedback

**Issues Encountered**: **NONE** - Sprint completed without any significant technical or design challenges

**Performance**: **ON TIME** - All tasks completed within sprint scope

## Sprint 3: Drag & Drop and Supabase Integration

**Objective**: Implement drag-and-drop functionality for stories and sprints, and integrate with Supabase for data persistence.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Supabase database integration with proper schema and RLS policies
- Drag-and-drop functionality using @hello-pangea/dnd library
- Real-time data persistence and synchronization
- Error handling and loading states for database operations
- Migration from local state to persistent storage

**Tasks**:
1. ✅ **Set up Supabase Integration**
2. ✅ **Create Database Schema and Migrations**
3. ✅ **Implement Drag & Drop Components**
4. ✅ **Add Error Handling and Loading States**
5. ✅ **Migrate from Local to Persistent State**

**Risk Assessment**: **HIGH**
- **Breaking Change Risk**: High. Complete migration from local state management to Supabase requires significant refactoring of existing components and data flow.
- **Technical Complexity**: High. Integration of drag-and-drop library with database persistence, real-time updates, and proper error handling.
- **Impact**: This sprint establishes the foundation for all future data persistence and real-time collaboration features.

## Sprint 4: AI Integration & Settings

**Objective**: Integrate the OpenAI API for intelligent story generation and prompt creation, and implement the comprehensive Settings modal.

**Risk Assessment**: **MEDIUM**

---

## Sprint 5: Archive Management & Search/Filter

**Objective**: Implement the archive view for completed stories and sprints, and provide comprehensive search and filter capabilities across all data.

**Risk Assessment**: **MEDIUM**

---

## Sprint 6: Polish & Deployment

**Objective**: Refine UI/UX, add final touches, and prepare the application for deployment.

**Risk Assessment**: **LOW**
